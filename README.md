## Access Residencies - Property Filtering Website

This project is a property filtering mechanism for the [https://accessresidencies.com/](https://accessresidencies.com/) website. It allows users to easily search for apartments, houses, lands, and commercial properties for sale or rent based on specific criteria.

### Project Goals

* Enhance user experience on the Access Residencies website by providing a filtering system for properties.
* Improve website organization by categorizing properties into clear sections (For Sale & For Rent) with subcategories based on property type (e.g., Apartment, House, Land, etc.).

    * Price/Rent
    * Size (Square Footage)
    * Bedrooms
    * Bathrooms
    * Location (District and Sub-areas)
    * Property Type (for Commercial Properties)
* Facilitate easy property sharing through social media and other channels.
* Increase website loading speed for optimal user experience.
